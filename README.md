# Quiz Application

This quiz application is for the NSE4 v7.2 certificate and presents a set of questions to the user, collects responses, and then displays the user's score. It reads questions from a CSV file, randomly selects 30 questions (out of a pool of 171 Knowledge Check questions), and shows a bar graph with the results, including category-wise percentages and a list of incorrect questions.
